							I know we have a lot of emotions attached to this one, It was not the ideal trip that we hopped it would be. Things went bad, but nothing we can't fix :).
							It has its ups though, YellowStone(Super Volcano), BigSur(I really hope you enjoyed the views), Breakfast at SAP, I bet you enjoyed it.
							Desert wine, cooking. Seattle <3, whale watching, Yash's pole dance, Watching Stranger things while being high, Cheese Cake Factory,
							The night when your brother paid the bills ;).
