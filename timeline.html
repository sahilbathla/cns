I hope you liked our gallery (chhavinsahil.co.in). But after that a great day out it was. We chilled at ambience mall, watched a movie then went shopping and then had a surprise party planned for you at your home. I hope you would have been delighted to see the faces of your loved ones that day.</div>

					<div class="desc">Chandratal, Spitti, Manali. Needless to say it was one of the kind of experience we had. That sleepless night in -5 degree celcius we spent camping without matresses will always be rememberred but it is so ironical that it went right away the next morning when we visited the mesmerising lake. Reminds me, we need to go to Leh and Ladakh</div>

					<div class="desc">Goa again, man we don't find any place to go, do we? It was fun again this time. To be honest I thought it won't be fun with Chinoy but we did manage to enjoy. The food this time was really great, be it Fisherman Coves(Candolim), Thalasa(Vagator) or Martins Corner, it was great. LPK was just average and we lost money this time in Deltin Jack. Charpora Fort, Morjim Beach, Arambol Trek were great :D.</div>

Afterall "its a competition and we are better then them " ;). Thanks for the short trip across the main parts of mumbai, my best part was the chicken bharwa at bade miyan</div>

					<div class="desc"> Vrindawan, a place both you and mom loved but I just found it too over crowded with superstitious people. Prem mandir was good though and food & prasad at escon was the best meal I had there. Sorry for blaming you on what Rachit said to me. I never want to fight you.</div>
